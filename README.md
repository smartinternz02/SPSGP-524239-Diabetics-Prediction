Diabetics Prediction

1.INTRODUCTION

OVERVIEW

Diabetes prediction involves assessing an individual's risk of developing diabetes in the future based on various factors such as their medical history, lifestyle, and genetic predisposition. Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels resulting from either insufficient insulin production or ineffective utilization of insulin by the body.

PURPOSE

Diabetes prediction helps in early intervention, personalized treatment plans, resource allocation, patient education, research, and public health initiatives to prevent or manage diabetes effectively and improve overall health outcomes.

2.PROPOSED SOLUTION

We used many models on the given data set to accurately predict whether the given patient has diabetes. A total of 5 algorithms(KNN, Logistic Regression , Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Decision Tree) were used on the given data with physical activity, age, cholesterol and others considered as attributes that impact the sugar level of the patients. Of all the models, we have taken the results of Logistic Regression model as it resulted in the closest approximation to predict whether the patient has diabetes. The logistic regression model will take the input features of an individual and provide a probability estimate of them having diabetes. A threshold is set to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on the predicted probabilities.
